/*Note: You can go up to 7, but only 5 display normally in the status screen, so the 6th and 7th entries of these are zeroed out
Technically, vanilla uses a support count. I'm technically not using it, but Builder will scream at you if it's not used
properly, so I'm doing it anyway with SupportCountAmount. 
The last two zeroes are for termination purposes and padding*/
